Project Title: Dynamic Pricing Strategy Based on Demand Forecasting
Project Overview:

This project aims to develop a dynamic pricing strategy by leveraging demand forecasting to adjust product prices based on predicted sales. The objective is to optimize pricing decisions in real-time, maximizing revenue while maintaining competitiveness. In its initial phase, the focus is on building a robust demand forecasting model using historical sales data, which will serve as the foundation for future dynamic pricing adjustments.

Objectives:

Demand Forecasting: Build a model to predict future sales using historical data, incorporating features like date, store, item, and previous sales.

Dynamic Pricing: Develop a pricing model that adjusts prices based on predicted demand to maximize revenue.

Revenue Optimization: Optimize pricing decisions by aligning them with forecasted demand, ensuring that prices are competitive and profit-maximizing.

Real-Time Adjustments: Create a framework that allows prices to be adjusted dynamically based on evolving demand predictions.

Approach:

Data Analysis & Feature Engineering: Use historical sales data (train.csv) and test data (test.csv) to analyze demand patterns and engineer features like lag variables (e.g., lag1, lag7, lag30) to capture trends and seasonality.

Demand Prediction Model: Train a Random Forest Regressor model to forecast future demand, evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Dynamic Pricing Algorithm: Develop an initial pricing strategy that adjusts prices based on predicted sales. Prices will be increased during high-demand periods and decreased during low-demand periods.

Next Steps:

The next phase will integrate price-related features, such as competitor prices and price elasticity, into the demand forecasting model. Over time, optimization algorithms and real-time data will be incorporated to enhance the dynamic pricing strategy.

Conclusion:

This project sets the foundation for a dynamic pricing solution, focusing on accurate demand forecasting to drive optimal pricing decisions, ultimately maximizing revenue and business profitability.
